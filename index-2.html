<p class="has-medium-font-size">Want to know how to shape your eyebrows like a pro? Want to know what to look for so you can scrutinize your brow tech? Our comprehensive eyebrow shaping guide will help you get the perfect arch, fullness, and/or definition that is best suited for your face shape, eyes, and brow growth. Find out which methods and products work best for you and learn simple techniques that can take your beauty game to the next level.</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>Choose the Right Eyebrow Shape for Your Face</strong></h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The key to creating the perfect eyebrows is finding the shape that best fits your face. Taking into consideration factors like forehead width, facial features, and overall proportions make all the difference. Oval, square, and round faces each require a slightly different approach when it comes to eyebrow shaping.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The first step to finding the right brow shape for you is to determine what your face shape actually is. Only when you know your face shape can you move on to step two—choosing the right brow shape to compliment your face.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 1: Finding Your Face Shape</strong></h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The shape of your face can be determined by looking at the proportions and angles of the forehead, cheekbones, jawline, and chin. To define your face shape, you can take measurements of your face, such as the distance between your forehead and chin or the width of your cheekbones. You can also compare your face shape to common shapes like round, oval, square, heart, and long. Additionally, you can look at the overall balance and symmetry of your features.</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding the Characteristics of the Six Face Shapes</strong></h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The six most common face shapes are:<br>1. Round<br>2. Oval<br>3. Square<br>4. Rectangle<br>5. Diamond<br>6. Heart</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>What Makes a Face Round Shaped?</strong></h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A round face shape is characterized by having a wide forehead and cheekbones that are the roughly same width/height, with a rounded jawline and a gentle curve to the chin. The perimeter of your face will curve slightly outward, even at your cheeks versus being straight or curved inwards. The distance from the forehead to the chin is typically similar to the width of the cheekbones, and the face shape overall has less defined softer angles. A round face shape is also often accompanied by a fuller cheek area, giving the face a circular appearance.</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>What Makes a Face Oval Shaped?</strong></h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">An oval-shaped face is characterized by having a forehead that is slightly wider than the chin, and high cheekbones that are slightly wider than the forehead. The jawline is also slightly curved and the overall face length is longer than the width. It&#8217;s common for the oval face shape to come with a relatively tall forehead. The oval shape is considered as a balanced and proportionate shape, this is why it&#8217;s often considered as an ideal face shape.</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>What Makes a Face Square Shaped?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A square face shape is characterized by having a strong, defined jawline and forehead that are roughly the same width/height. The cheekbones are also prominent and angular, and the face shape overall has more defined angles and edges. The jawline is usually sharp and the corners of the face are a bit more angular. The length of the face is often similar to the width, giving a more geometric shape to the face.</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>What Makes a Face Rectangle Shaped?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A rectangular face shape is characterized by having a forehead, cheekbones, and jawline that are all roughly the same width, from top to bottom. The overall face shape is longer than it is wide, and the jawline can be either squared or the chin can have a sharp angle too. The cheekbones are usually not as prominent as the other face shapes and the forehead is usually high. The chin is usually slightly pointed giving a rectangular shape to the face.</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>What Makes a Face Diamond Shaped?</strong></h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A diamond-shaped face is characterized by having high cheekbones that are the widest part of the face, with a narrow forehead and jawline. The chin is usually pointed giving a diamond shape to the face. The face shape overall is angular, with defined cheekbones, and the forehead and jawline are smaller in comparison to the cheekbones. Diamond-shaped faces are considered rare face shapes.</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>What Makes a Face Heart Shaped?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A heart-shaped face is characterized by having a wide forehead, high cheekbones, and a narrow jawline and chin. This face shape overall is similar to an inverted triangle. The forehead is usually the widest part of the face, and the face tapers down to a point at the chin. The jawline and chin are usually pointed and small in comparison to the forehead. The cheekbones are usually high and prominent. This face shape can be symmetrical or asymmetrical.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Once you&#8217;ve determined your face shape, an expert can advise you on brows that will complement it.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>Step 2: Choosing the Right Brow Shape for You</strong></h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">An eyebrow shape can complement your face shape by creating balance and symmetry in the proportions of your face. Different face shapes have different ideal brow shapes that can help balance out the features.</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding the Concept of Balancing Face &amp; Brow Shape</strong></h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">An oval-shaped face is considered to be the most &#8220;balanced&#8221; shape. As a result, someone with an oval face can choose just about any brow shape they like. Still, the brow shape can be adjusted to suit unique characteristics or preferences.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>The Best Brow for a Round Face</strong></h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For a round face, the best eyebrow shape to pick is one that will visually make your face look longer and thinner. The optimal shape should feature a soft arch that is slightly angled and higher than the brow line to lift your features giving the illusion of an elongated face. When done correctly, this type of eyebrow will provide definition to your facial features and help balance out any roundness in your face.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>The Best Brow for an Oval Face</strong></h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you have an oval-shaped face, then you have an advantage as this is considered the ideal facial shape for eyebrow grooming. To enhance the natural symmetry of your face, it’s recommended to opt for an angular eyebrow shape that has a slightly high arc and a tail that curves outwards ever so slightly. This will work to frame your face while emphasizing its length and adding more definition to your features.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>The Best Brow for a Square Face</strong></h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If you have a square-shaped face, you’ll want an eyebrow shape that complements it by softening the angular lines of your jaw and forehead. This can be achieved with an oval or curved eyebrow shape that has a slightly curved arch and a tail pointing outwards, rather than straight down. An important tip for achieving those perfectly groomed eyebrows is to create multiple short strokes when filling in sparse areas instead of drawing one long line.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>The Best Brow for a Rectangle Face</strong></h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For a rectangular or oblong face shape, you’ll want to opt for a curved eyebrow shape with a lower arch in order to widen the face and reduce any harsh lines. Creating an almost complete circle at the top of the brow is a great way to add fullness and dimension. Start by filling in sparse areas with short strokes for more natural-looking results, then use a spoolie brush to soften and spread any pigment evenly.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>The Best Brow for a Diamond-Shaped Face</strong></h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">People with diamond-shaped faces will benefit from a high pointed arch above the brow, which draws attention to the outer corners of the eyes while widening and balancing out the overall narrow shape of their face. The arch should begin at the inner corner of your eyebrow and follow the curve of your forehead down to its highest point before gradually fading off in a smooth line toward the brow’s outer edge. Start by lightly sketching out any desired shape with a pencil before filling in your eyebrows with powder or cream to achieve precise results.</p>



<h2 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>The Best Brow for a Heart-Shaped Face</strong></h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">When it comes to heart-shaped faces, the best eyebrow choice is usually a slightly rounded arch. A brow shape that is flatter and straighter with a slight arch is usually flattering. This helps to create the illusion of a wider jawline and balance the proportions of the face. Softening the angular features will create more of a curved look. A small or medium arch will also draw attention to your eyes, making them appear larger and more prominent. When styling your eyebrows, focus on filling in any sparse areas without over-plumping them, as this can create an overly dramatic look. Finally, be sure to keep your brows even and symmetrical &#8211; this will help ensure a balanced overall aesthetic.</p>



<h3 class="has-medium-font-size wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Keeping your brows well-groomed and well-defined can also help balance out the face. Avoiding a highly arched brow can help prevent over-accentuation of the forehead.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s important to note that everyone&#8217;s face is unique and ultimately, it&#8217;s up to the individual to find the best brow shape that they feel comfortable with and suits their face.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">A professional can help you to determine the best brow shape for your face and help you to achieve the look you desire most.</p>
